This Slackbot that receives input through a [slash command](https://api.slack.com/slash-commands) and sends a request to an API.

A detailed tutorial about how I built this is on Medium: [https://goo.gl/wDyayI](https://goo.gl/wDyayI)

## Installation

Clone the repo and then install dependencies:

    git clone git@github.com:mager/slack-genius.git
    cd slack-genius
    npm i


Setup the server (I used Heroku):

    heroku create my-slackbot


Set Heroku environment variable for [Genius access token](https://genius.com/api-clients):

    heroku config:add GENIUS_ACCESS=[your Genius access token]
    git push heroku master


Setup Slack slash command:

* Goto `http://[your-slack-team].slack.com/apps/manage/custom-integrations` and add a slash command.
* Fill in the fields:
  * _Command_: the name of your slash command (ex: `/genius`)
  * _URL_: The URL to request when the slash command is run (ex: `https://my-slackbot.herokuapp.com/post`)
  * _Method_: POST
  * _Customize Name_: The name of your Slackbot
  * _Customize Icon_: A custom icon or an emoji
  * _Autocomplete help text_: Helps users when they start typing `/`
  * _Descriptive Label_: Provides extra context


## Usage

In Slack, send slash commands to /genius:
